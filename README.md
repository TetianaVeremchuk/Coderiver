## Text Animation
Smooth text animation has been added to enhance the user experience:
- Texts (headings, descriptions, and other information) are hidden initially.
- On page load, they appear gradually with a subtle fade-in and upward motion effect.

## 3D Scene Implementation
An interactive 3D starry background has been integrated into the section:
- Stars are randomly generated in a 3D space.
- The scene is created using `React-Three-Fiber` and `Three.js`.
- Interactive elements: Stars react to mouse movements, adding a dynamic and engaging effect.
- The scene operates smoothly, enhancing the overall design aesthetics.
